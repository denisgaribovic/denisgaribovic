👋 Hi there! I’m Denis Garibovic, an enthusiastic Data Analyst from Germany. Welcome to my GitHub where I showcase my personal projects! But first, some background information about me:

🔥 I discovered my passion for data and technology in my early 20s and since then, my passion and desire to be curious has driven me to work at renowned German companies like Tchibo, OTTO and Bonprix, where I've honed my expertise and analytical skill set.

🚀 Throughout my career, I have delivered impactful solutions that drive business success, such as developing machine learning models to accurately forecast online sales, creating data visualizations and interactive dashboards, deriving actionable insights from complex datasets and automating data pipelines to reduce manual workload.

💻 My technical skills include utilizing SQL and Python for advanced data analysis and Machine Learning. I have hands-on experience with cloud environments such as Google Cloud Platform and data warehouses like Google BigQuery. Specializing in Digital Analytics, I am also proficient in Google Analytics (GA4) and data visualization tools like Looker Studio and Tableau.

🤝 Beyond my technical skills, I excel in communication and collaboration, enabling me to work effectively with stakeholders and present insights to diverse audiences.
